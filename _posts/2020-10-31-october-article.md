    UNDM Rocked the Block Party
---

On October 2nd, UNDM held its second annual For The Kids on the Block Party. Staff members, registrants, and the UNL community joined at the Union Greenspace for a night of live entertainment, lawn games, and fun.  This was the first major event of the academic year for UNL Dance Marathon, and one of the first university sponsored events allowed with the proper safety precautions due to COVID-19.  Attendees were asked to socially distance in lines and while watching the performances, all while wearing face masks.  However, the extra safety measures did not diminish the morale or excitement for anyone in attendance.

This year’s Block Party focused on live entertainment from talented UNL students.  Carrigan Hurst and Kimberly Law performed a fiery baton twirling act that captivated everyone’s attention.  There were also many vocal performances, such as by the acapella group Pitch Please. karaoke,  and Elizabeth Nesland with Elise Friesen on the piano.  Elizabeth serves as the Community Relations Chair for DM, and she jumped at the opportunity to perform covers of “Dancing Queen” by ABBA and “Set Fire to the Rain” by Adele.  “It was a great way to use my talents for a wonderful cause,” said Elizabeth. “It was so fun to have people there to cheer me on that I spend all year with.”  

Overall, the Block Party was a huge success, thanks to the staff, registrants, and sponsors. DM gained 190 registrants in 4 hours! We hope to have more events soon to bring together UNDM and the UNL community while raising awareness for children’s health.
