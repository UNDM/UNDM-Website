				<h3>Ashley McMurchie</h3>
				<p>Executive Director/President</p>
				<p>The President of UNDM serves as the liaison between Dance Marathon and UNL. Running mostly behind the scenes, the president makes sure her team of hard-working, passionate individuals has a smooth year.</p>
				<p>Ashley has been making a difference with Dance Marathon for 4 years. Her favorite memory is her first bracelet cutting ceremony or being Elliot's family rep! The bracelet cutting ceremony hit home and solidified to her why UNDM raises money and awareness for the Children's Hospital.  Being Elliot's family representative was also rewarding because she spent all of HuskerThon 2020 with him and was able to see the joy this event brings our Miracle Kids.</p>
